# Widgets modeling 

In this repository, you can find everything about our work on defining, modeling and implementing widgets using FSAs. 

# Theory

To understand it, simply read the two PDF files that you can find in the main folder: "Widgets-MasterList" and "widgets-building-blocks". In those files, you can find every detail about the theoretical aspects of our work.

# Examples

- Every folder contains an implementation, done with JavaScript, html, and the XState library, of an atomic widget. 
- The "crossfilter" and "iris-visualization" folders contain more complex examples of how our theory can be applied to real visualizations.
-	Refer to the readme of each folder to understand more details and how to run each example.
