# Tooltip

Simple implementation of the statechart for tooltip.

Note: In this implementation, once the tooltip appears, mouse movements inside the button will not affect the position of the tooltip.

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Open the console and see the state transitions as they happen.
