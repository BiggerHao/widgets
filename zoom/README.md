# Zoom

Very simple zoom model, with its html/javascript/xstate implementation.

## ToDo

It works fine; it has a data model that is updated correctly, but the transition back to "hovering" after a zoom is not eventless as in the model.

### How to use

1. Run a server on your machine (e.g., using the command "python -m http.server" from this folder.
2. Open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.
3. Open the console and see the state transitions as they happen.
